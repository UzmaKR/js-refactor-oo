## Overview
As a professional programmer, you'll wind up dealing with some very hairy
JavaScript. This challenge asks you to take some rather nasty procedural code
and refactor it to object oriented JavaScript.

Feel free to use ruby-esque pseudocode to help you break down the problems.

### Core
Refactor the pile-O Javascript using either Object Literals or Prototypical
Inheritance. Put as little as possible into the global scope!

#### Objectives
1. Provide good names for all anonymous functions.
2. Move the anonymous functions to objects.

#### You Will Know You Are Done When:
Each callback or event handler is only 1 or 2 lines, and you have a clear
seperation of concerns.
